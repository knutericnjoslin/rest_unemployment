fxn_belief_moments
------------------

Computes the first four moments and variance of the posterior
belief of the agent about the probability that the economy is 
in the good state. Since the agent has a prior belief, the agent 
perceives that he or she is drawing from a *mixed distribution* 
in which pi_prior of the observations coming from the good 
state and the remainder from the bad state. 


### Input

pi_prior: The agent's belief about the probability of being in the good state.


### Script 

1. u and v are vectors of 10,000 draws from a uniform
2. Use inverse normal to generate two vectors with 
10,000 draws from a normal distribution:
    *The first vector, w_norm_mu_0 are draws from a normal with mean 0 and variance 1
    *The second vector, w_norm_mu_1 are draws from a normal with mean 1 and variance 1	
3. Makes draws from a mixed distribution. That is, for a proportion 
pi_prior make draws  from the good state distribution, w_norm_mu_0, 
and for a proportion 1-pi_prior make draws from the bad
state distribution w_norm_mu_0 (select which by using conditional 
v <= pi_prior). This mixed distribution gives the agents' beliefs  
about the wage generated by the (uncertain) state of the economy. 
4. Computes the posterior belief associated with the given observation 
5. Based on the 10,000 draws, computes the simulated moments of the
posterior belief. 

### Output 

Y: 1x5 vector containing the first four moments of the the simulated posteriors, Y(1) ... Y(4), 
as well as the varaince of the simulated posteriors, Y(5).
